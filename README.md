# Telecom Churn Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains Python code for analyzing telecom churn data. The dataset includes information about customers, their usage patterns, and whether they churned or not.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is stored in CSV format and can be found [here](/path/to/dataset/telecom_churn.csv).

## Code Overview
The analysis is performed using Python and the Pandas library. The main script, `telecom_churn_analysis.py`, covers the following aspects:

1. **Data Loading and Overview**
   - Loading the dataset using Pandas
   - Displaying basic information about the dataset such as shape, columns, and data types

2. **Descriptive Statistics**
   - Calculating and displaying descriptive statistics for numerical features

3. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Converting data types
   - Handling missing values

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualizing data distributions
   - Analyzing churn distribution
   - Sorting and filtering data for insights

5. **Applying Functions to Columns, Rows, and Cells**
   - Using the `apply` method
   - Replacing values using the `map` method

6. **Indexing and Retrieving Data**
   - Indexing with `loc` and `iloc`
   - Selecting specific rows and columns

7. **Conclusion and Findings**
   - Summarizing key findings from the analysis

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (`numpy` and `pandas`).
3. Run the `telecom_churn_analysis.py` script in your Python environment.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your needs.
